6,43090188-8d36-454d-a60d-3d41b7a7f489,I've done gymnastics and i know the mental blocks she's trying to say. I've had ADHD(lot severe as a child but now fine) and it's no joke especially if you're training as a gymnast. The anxiety is insane and sometimes panic attacks came out of nowhere. I remember in one of my competition i only did floor and vault after having a panic attack but nobody around me realized that. I quit other events and my coaches scolded me (they didn't even bother to ask why) and i fell on both floor and vault(ditched the other 4 right away). It was scary i felt like the whole crowd was looking and laughing at me and i felt completely abandoned... I hope people realizes the mental process in this sport and love you simone you showed the world that mental health matters too ❤,Gymnastics aloud,1 week ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/post/UgwQAorEaEt17J74KnZ4AaABCQ,2021-08-10
