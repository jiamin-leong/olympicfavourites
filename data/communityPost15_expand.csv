Gymnastics is a sport where narrative worth more than sport itself. In the last East Germany olympics in 88, an unambiguously undeserved perfect ten for Dagmar Kersten. Shannon Miller losing the AA to Tatiana Gutsu in 92 because the last olympics for URSS. Last perfect 10, undeserved for Lavinia Milosovic, the last one by a romanian as if was the very first while hungarian Henrietta Onodi did a mostly perfect routine. And so on..
