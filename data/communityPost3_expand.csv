For me it's between Vanessa and Mykayla. This was Vanessa's 4th Olympics and she has been one of the queens of 4th place. Her finally winning an Olympic medal after performing to ""Time to Say Goodbye"" was exquisite. Mykayla, on the other hand, gave us something right out of a storybook. After prelims, she thought her career was over. One week later, a twist of fate and a few twists through the air and she was on the podium as an Olympic silver medalist.

Skinner is an inspiration overall. I don‚Äôt think she would have attempted a comeback because she was terrified of going to the camps. Simone convinced her that it was nothing like it was at the ranch. To get married in the meantime too? Both her and her husband are so sweet together. That is a heartwarming story in itself considering how Marta probably would not have taken her seriously with things factored in had she still been in charge.

28,3a881a70-0240-4593-af39-530eca4fbeba,"The whole US team walking away with medals is such an amazing thing. Especially for the two girls that got the individual spots and were looked at as unlikely to even make it to finals. Through all the obstacles and challenges  the whole story is so beautiful. Simone's struggle allowed for every single one of the gymnasts to shine and seeing her 'beaming' (ha) smile when she landed off of the beam wrapped it up perfectly. It's true it was never about the numbers it was always about showing what you have as a person. Mykayla thought she was going home, career over with no Olympic medals, sad but proud. Jade messed up and thought she blew her chance turned around and won gold in the next event and Suni stepped up as a leader and pulled the USA team to silver and snagged the gold AA. Proving that she is with the best of the best in the history of the sport. Finally Simone's mental struggle illuminated so many issues and realities in gymnastics and for athletes. He bravery in overcoming it and getting that bronze shows her perserverence and how she is indeed always just competing with herself. That's why she got up there and that's why she had such a huge smile, because once again she showed everyone what she's made of. She had nothing to prove to anyone but herself.

156,aeb0fa47-6b51-4a4b-b906-0ccf06bb280b,"how people are not voting for Vanessa?Like okay I get it for MyKayla but here we're talking about someone who's 30 and, after being World champion on almost every event in 2006, in every Olympics finished always in 4th place. Competing in 2008 with injury, in 2012 finished 4th because of that stupid rule even tho she had the same final score of Aliya Mustafina, in 2016 the judges still didn't want her to win so she finished 4th, again. In 2017 she got injured so bad, she had to stop for a year and half but she still wanted that medal at the Olympics. On her forth Olympics she supposed to compete as individual but since Giorgia Villa got injured she replaced her in the team training and competing on every apparatus, because the team needed her, and they ended up 4th. But it's still a record for italian artistic gymnastics. At the age of 30 she finally made it, she won that medal, doing the best exercise of her life AND STILL many people think she deserved the gold. (And so do I). Vanessa is a symbol of perseverance, courage, and hard working job. That silver medal is unbelievable, but she still wanted the gold. Because she's not a surrender. All due respect to MyKayla, but Vanessa made history here.",Mery Sss,4 days ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/post/UgyLrlhAZguOsdfXNlF4AaABCQ,2021-08-10
