This is why the team/individual stuff is a load of crap. All six team members should have competed for each team in the top eight. It isnâ€™t like NBC shows every routine anyway. A six person team needs to happen. The FIG can still have individuals make it just like Rebeca did. The top teams have enough talent to bring six.
