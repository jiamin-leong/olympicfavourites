That Floor field was stacked, she got iced by the judges, they showed video of her crying and failing on vault right before her routine. It was her last chance to have any medal and the pressure was insane. Then her performance was truly dominant - she blew away that incredibly talented group. It was my most thrilling Olympic moment possibly ever. I was crying as soon as she hit that first tumbling pass, and the replays still bring the tears.",Snowmobile Home Movies,6 days ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugxtkwg68iA4EV3ZLQZ4AaABCQ,2021-08-10
