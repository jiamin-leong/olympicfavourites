35,de03c425-f006-4037-a0b8-e2492c2435d2,"Yay! That's great! I'm really hoping Simone gets an individual medal. I hope she can, and is able to, give this everything she has. My heart just breaks for her having to pull out of all the events she thought she would be mentally prepared to do, then wasn't. The world has really come down hard on her about it too. People that have never done a cartwheel in their life can't imagine how you can get the twisties or even what they are. I heard one podcaster say that ""it's not like she could die or anything"" when actually many, many gymnasts have been paralyzed and/or died. Sports are physical AND mental. People act like she wanted to not compete in the Olympics. She worked her whole life so far to compete in the Olympics. Like she WANTED to pull out? And the embarrassment of knowing people who don't understand and are disappointed in you on top of your own disappointment. Probably lost some endorsements. Watched her team get silver instead of gold if she had been on...but she could've watched her team get 4th if she had been off and still competed. Might could've watched it from the hospital after she broke her neck...etc etc you guys loved her when she had perfect days and brought home gold medals galore for USA. She's always put her hand over her heart and stood up for our national anthem. I recall Gabby Douglas not putting her hand over her heart and I watched the US soccer team all kneel. But Simone loves her country and she doesn't use her platform and attention to ever take shots at our country....she has the sweetest heart. So let's love her when she is having a bad week too, she has a great talent but only has the mind of a human. The mind of a fierce competitor, but still she suffers the same insecurities we all are prone too. I bet if you were flinging yourself 13 feet into the air to twist 3 times upside down you might get a little spacial disorientation too and fail to recognize where you are in the air at some point. I bet at some point your muscle memory would fail you too. This happening at the Olympics of all places I'm sure has been her worst nightmare! Have some compassion. Even the best fall down sometimes...and the best get back up, and now she's getting back up, so show your support! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü§∏üèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è CMON NOW THAT'S OUR GIRL!",Lady Jay Mac,1 week ago (edited),https://www.youtube.com/post/UgxVXbye7rjI9Tmkbyd4AaABCQ,2021-08-10
