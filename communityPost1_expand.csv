1,acf623dd-c3cb-46b5-a6cb-63a60fbf2831,It‚Äôs too soon to tell to be honest. I have to say Chellsie is looking good in training. My gut says Laurie is probably done. Leanne Wong would be the most likely as she is still young and could hold on three more years. Riley and Morgan are headed to Florida to compete. Who knows though because anything can happen. Mykayla proved that this year. I can‚Äôt say about Jade. Skill wise she could but she needs to rest a bit and I think she is headed to college too. This years ladies have a new chance to earn money off their win and still compete for the NCAA which is awesome and is going to a HUGE draw for NCAA competitions. ,Heather Wicker,1 day ago,https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugxpr8dYg8Jb78K7IFF4AaABCQ,2021-08-10
